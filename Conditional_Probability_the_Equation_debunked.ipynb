        "Equation (1) is used to obtain the Probablity of an event $A$ to happen given that event $B$ has already occured. To explain this equation, Let our sample space (The set of all possible outcomes) be $S$. All elements in S have the same likelihood to happen. Which makes us uncertain to predict the outcome. $A$ and $B$ are two events. That means they are the two subsets of $S$. We know that, $P(B) = \\frac{n(B)}{n(S)}$, where $n(B)$ is the number of elements in set $B$ and $n(S)$ is the number of elements in Sample Space.\n",

        "How this equation is obtained ? To find the probability of an Event we have to find its Propotion in relation with Possible Outcomes. Sample space $S$, is a set of possible outcomes, and set $B$ is a subset of $S$ which is also a set containing outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now getting back to equation (1), The objective of that equation is two find probability of an event $A$ to happen if already event $B$ has happend. If I further elaborate (1), The objective is to find out the probabibity of both $A$ and $B$ to happen if $B$ already happened. The clause $B$ already happened have very high significance. Since $B$ is already happend it reduced the number of possible outcomes from $n(S)$ to $n(B)$. Happening of $B$ makes the possibility of $B^\\complement$ to happen $0$. That means $S-B$ can't be considered as a set of possible outcomes. Thus $B$ is our new $S$, formally speaking our new Sample Space.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our new Sample Space may include subsets like $(A \\cap B), (C \\cap B), (D \\cap B)$ and so on. Our interest is only to find the propotion of set $(A \\cap B ) $ in relation to $B$ (the new sample space). Because $P(A|B)$ is simply is the conditional probability of of an event $A$ to happen given that $B$ is already happened. That means, it is the probability of both $A$ and $B$ to happen if $B$ is our sample space ($B$ already happened). If we translate this statement into an equation it becomes as (2) \n",
